bugs
====
graphic health upgrade status - isn't always aligned - doesn't always show everything
axe should upgrade if close, build tower if held and pointing at ground, attack if hit enemy
make sure melee attacks work for ogre, shambler, hellknight
prevent monsters from spawning when far away
fish don't swim to player before sight
vores can't seem to handle two grunts...
prevent monsters attacking each other
placement indicator never goes away if button held at death

more features
===============
monsters run rather than walk to player	
allow gradual tuning of respawns - faster stronger etx
quad dmg affects towers
test in mp
build a level
build tutorial
tunable towers (random strength, random upgrade level, speed)
graphical differentiation for monsters, towers, enemy towers, other players
maybe upgrading a tower should pause the tower briefly - more of a penalty
maybe towers shouldn't be ready right away - slow down how fast they can be made
reverse gib explosions?
prevent too many monsters,
